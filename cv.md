## **About Me**
*Master's degree in Intelligent Computer Systems Design from Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. At the university I had experience in the team for developing the GIT commit history simplifier utility as a project manager [GitHub, Git history linearizer](https://github.com/luxdarkr/git_history_linearizer). I also received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Security at Ufa State Aviation Technical University. In parallel with programming I am studying software testing. In the future I want to combine the knowledge I got in these fields to automate testing.
For me the main goal is to get knowledge and experience in programming and software testing. Due to my extensive experience in sales, I know how to approach people.
I am sociable, attentive, love to learn and know how to properly allocate my time and work in a team.*
